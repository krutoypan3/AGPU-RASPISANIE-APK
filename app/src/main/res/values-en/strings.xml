    <string name="app_info_body">This application was developed by a student of the Armavir State Pedagogical University of his own free will for the benefit of others.\n\nIf you are reading this, then I will tell you about this wonderful application.\n\nI, the developer of this miracle, worked tirelessly for a year to write a convenient application for displaying the current schedule.\n\nThe content of this application does not aim to offend or offend anyone, all media content of the application is in the public domain and does not violate copyright, if you think that this is not the case, write about it in the feedback form.\n\nThe source code for the application is on my github account, which can be accessed from the side menu.\n\nThe application only collects data about the technical characteristics of the device to ensure greater compatibility.\n\nBy installing this application, you automatically give me, the developer of the application, your consent to take a loan in your name at no charge. Joking aside, I didn\'t get a penny for the apps. Everything was done for students and teachers, everything for the sake of convenience and of course everything is free.\n\nNaturally, there will be no ads in the application, no one wants to see ads on the floor of the screen while viewing the schedule.\n\nWith you, in the data immortalized in the code, I was Artem Mikhailovich Oganesyan. Thanks for using the app.</string>
